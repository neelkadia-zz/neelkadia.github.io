      <p class="f5 black">Every one of us know what is the child labour, Most of us have seen one or more child labours at Tea Store, Vegetable shops, etc. In most of us, we worry about them, we donate them. Some of the active people from us would contact NGO and tell information about this child. These are the normal scenarios. If every people just send the information about a child to various NGOs nearby the area. At least some of them would be saved. We should worry more about the children which are forcefully bonded in various Factories. It includes sugar mills, Automotive industry and Water purifying and packaging plant.</p>
