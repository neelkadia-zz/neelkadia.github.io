        <p class="p">Every one of us know what is the child labour, Most from us have seen one or more child labours at Tea Store, Vegetable shops, etc. In most of us, we worry about them, we donate them. Some of the active people from us would contact NGO and tell information about these child. These are the normal senarioes. If every people just send the information about child to various NGOs nearby the area. Atleast some of them would be saved. We should worry more about the childerns which are focefully bonded in various Factories. It incudes suger mills, Automotive industry and Water purifying and pacakging plant.</p>

        <p class="p">We need to Stop this and Everyone should contribute for it.</p>
